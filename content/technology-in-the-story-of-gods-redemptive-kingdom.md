American culture is obsessed with the idea of progress. Progress has been embedded in the American narrative from the very beginning of its history, as colonists arrived and continually moved west in the belief that something more, something better, always awaited them tomorrow. The American Dream is the continuation of that ideal of Manifest Destiny — we always believe that there's a better life out there if we're willing to work hard. And while Manifest Destiny and the American Dream have rightfully been criticized for the horrible sufferings they inflicted on Native Americans and African Americans among other groups, the idea of progress at their root persists more strongly in Silicon Valley than virtually anywhere else. Rather than being laughed at, wildly optimistic visions of the future are encouraged (and often backed by large amounts of money). And while the claims made are often fantastic and far from reality<sup>[1](#Footnotes)</sup>, Silicon Valley's optimism is validated by the radical reshaping of society according to the vision of leaders of tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft in recent years.

Our culture's desire for progress, however flawed it often may be, is propelled by a good and universal human desire — the desire for a more prosperous, joyful, and just society than the one we were born into.

> God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground." <br> - Genesis 1:29
