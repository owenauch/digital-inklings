I'm a software engineer in San Francisco. I'm also a Christian. Those two identities don't often coexist. In the words of Erlich Bachman from the TV show *Silicon Valley*:

> "Christianity is borderline illegal in Northern California."

Though it's over the top, the quote captures something about the sentiment around religious faith in Silicon Valley. People generally don't think of believing in and practicing the Christian faith as a good thing. Sometimes people see it as harmful and backwards — something to be fought against. But most often, believing in Christianity gets lumped in with other morally neutral personal preferences, such as enjoying a certain type of music. It's something you're free to believe and practice as long as it's private to you and doesn't affect anyone else. But you certainly shouldn't bring it into your your thinking about technology or your work as you build software. Tech and faith have nothing to do with one another.

But while I may have agreed in the past that tech and faith were unrelated, I've come to believe that they're deeply intertwined. The reason why deserves a much deeper dive, but I'll explain briefly.

### The relevance of faith to technology

The gospel of Jesus is the belief that God became a human being in ancient Palestine, was excruciatingly executed by people he created in order to take away the sin of the world, rose three days later from the dead, and continues to live today, asking us to know and follow him. One sentence cannot possibly summarize an event that, if true, is without a doubt the most important thing to happen in the history of the world. If we believe the gospel of Jesus to be true, it must weigh into everything else we believe and know.

In his book *Proper Confidence*, Lesslie Newbigin says:

> "At the heart of the Christian message was a new fact: God had acted... God had acted in a way that, if believed, must henceforth determine all of our ways of thinking. It could not merely fit into existing ways of understanding the world without fundamentally changing them... It could not form part of any worldview except one of which it was the basis."

Imagine if I told you that every person you interacted with actually a robot. If you believed me, it would fundamentally change your thinking about everything in life. You'd think differently about friendship, art, work, sports — everything would have to be reconsidered based on that fact.

The same is true of the gospel of Jesus. If we believe that Jesus lived, died and rose from the dead and we take the invitation to follow him seriously, we have to reconsider everything in life. Jesus calls us to reevaluate how we look at others, how we spend our time, how we think about money, how we prepare for death, how we understand culture, how we administer justice, how we think about science, and much more in light of the gospel. Technology and our work in it is another one of these many areas we need to rethink in light of the gospel, and this blog is where I intend to begin doing that.

### Motivations and goals for writing

I intend to use this blog as a place to write about the ways in which Chrisitian faith informs our understanding of technology. I'm doing this for a couple of reasons:
* Digital technology has radically reshaped our world. Every facet of our lives has been transformed by phones, computers, and other technology. We need to think about how to live, work and play in our digital world in a holy way.
* I lack a vision of what technology looks like in the kingdom of heaven. If the technology we creat will ultimately be redeemed and perfected as a part of heaven one day (which I believe it will be — spoiler alert for a future post), it's worth asking the question what that redeemed technology looks like and how we can move towards it in our work today.
* Because the world of technology often lacks Christians, I desire to provide a Christian voice in the conversation around technology. Because technology is so culturally powerful, the ideas we have about it are incredibly important to the lives of people all over the world. I want the Christian worldview to be represented in those ideas.

But despite my desire to have a voice in conversations about technology, my ultimate goal of writing is to learn and understand for my own sake. Writing is the most effective form of thinking for me — forcing myself to write about technology and faith will bring far more clarity to these topics than just allowing ideas to bounce around in my head. As a result, these posts will likely be exploratory in nature and focused on nuanced understanding rather than giving clean positions and answers (similar to [Paul Graham's philosophy on essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html)).

### Assumptions

There are a couple of ideas that I will take for granted as I write. Like axioms for a mathematical proof, we need some facts that we consider self-evidently true or we can't make progress towards learning something new. These axioms certainly aren't as self-evident as something like "1 is an odd number" — they're ideas that I've wrestled with and questioned extensively in my life. But I ultimately believe them to be true and worth believing, and I'll try to offer (very brief) reasons why they might be true, along with some resources at the end.

#### 1) Jesus's life, death and resurrection were real historical events.
Jesus's life and crucifixion are generally agreed upon by historians to be historical fact. And if we don't rule out the supernatural out of hand, Jesus's resurrection is the best explanation of several other generally agreed upon facts. Why else would Jesus's tomb have been found empty by a group of women? Why else would his disciples and many other claim to have seen and interacted with who they thought was the resurrected Jesus? Why else would his followers transform from terrified fishermen to fearless preachers who were willing to die to tell people that Jesus rose from the dead? All of this evidence and more leads me to believe that Jesus's life, death and resurrection as described in the Bible are true historical events.
#### 2) The Bible is true and authoratative.
If we believe the first axiom, then we can believe Jesus when he says, "Scripture cannot be broken" (John 10:35) — he believed it to be truthful and reliable. This is supported by prophecy in the Old Testament that predicted events hundreds of years before they happened, and the preservation of far more ancient Bible manuscripts than any other ancient text. This leads me to believe that the Bible, understood and applied rightly, is an authoritative source of truth.

## Closing thoughts
I'm excited to finally get pen to paper (digitally) and dive into writing about faith, technology and all the questions posed by their intersection. I'm writing this as an opportunity to learn and grow my own understanding, so I'm open to questions, further discussion, theological correction or anything else. The best place to reach me is probably on Twitter at [@owenauch](https://twitter.com/owenauch). Because of other commitments, I likely won't post with consistency, so you can sign up below to recieve an update via email whenever I post. Thanks for reading!
