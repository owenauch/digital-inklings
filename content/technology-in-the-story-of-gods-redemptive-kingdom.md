American culture is obsessed with the idea of progress. Progress has been embedded in the American narrative from the very beginning of its history, as colonists arrived and continually moved west in the belief that something more, something better, always awaited them tomorrow. The American Dream is the continuation of that ideal of Manifest Destiny — we always believe that there's a better life out there if we're willing to work hard. And while Manifest Destiny and the American Dream have rightfully been criticized for the horrible sufferings they inflicted on Native Americans and African Americans among other groups, the idea of progress at their root persists more strongly in Silicon Valley than virtually anywhere else. Rather than being laughed at, wildly optimistic visions of the future are encouraged (and often backed by large amounts of money). And while the claims made are often fantastic and far from reality<sup>[1](#Footnotes)</sup>, Silicon Valley's optimism is validated by the radical reshaping of society according to the vision of leaders of tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft in recent years.

Our culture's desire for progress, however flawed it often may be, is propelled by a good and universal human desire — the desire for a more prosperous, joyful, and just society than the one we were born into. We see this good desire constantly reflected in the narrative of the Bible. In this post, we'll look at the idea of progress at the beginning and end of the human story in the Bible; in a following post<sup>[2](#Footnotes)</sup>, we'll find out how we should think about progress in the middle of the human story, where we live now. Because technology is often the means through which we seek progress, understanding the Biblical narrative of progress is crucial groundwork to finding a vision of redeemed technology.

###  The Cultural Mandate

We are introduced to the idea of human progress in the very first chapter of the Bible. After God creates humans and places them in the Garden of Eden<sup>[3](#Footnotes)</sup>, God gives them, and consequently the rest of humanity, his first command, which theologians call [The Cultural Mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_mandate):

> God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground." <br> - Genesis 1:29

God, who just created everything and rules over it, invites humans to create and rule over it with him. God subsequently [rests from his work in creation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A2&version=NIV), but the work of creation isn't finished. Unlike other  creatures, God offers us the opportunity to be coworkers with him in the continuing work of creating and forming the world.

As God's image-bearers<sup>[4](#Footnotes)</sup>, we reflect God's creative character, but we don't exactly match his abilities. There aren't many people who can speak matter into existence or create life out of nothingness — God does those things with ease. But the world of Genesis is full of abundant raw materials — it's described as a garden full of water, trees, plants, birds, animals and fish. By making new things using the raw materials that have been given to us, we fulfill our role as coworkers in creation with God.

At its simplest, technology is simply the output of this creative process. One definition of technology is that it is the creative use of raw materials to accomplish or produce something that previously wasn't attainable. We can fulfill the Cultural Mandate in many ways, but creating new technology is clearly a way we participating in the creative work of God.

Furthermore, the exact language of the command to "be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it" also necessitates the creation of technology. The earliest technology of food production — grabbing food you find with your hands and eating it — could never sustain a population that would "fill the earth". Without technological progress, we could never fill the earth, let alone subdue it. Technological progress is crucial to every part of this commandment, which in many ways serves as God's mission and purpose for humanity.

### A New, Perfect City

From the creation account, we see that God intended humans to pursue progress, including technological progress, from the very beginning. But what is the purpose of this progress? To ask the existential question, why would God command humans to create new things and make the world better matter if we all die and everything we do will be destroyed by the inevitable heat death of the universe?

Thankfully, God promises us something beyond our death and the universe's death. Heaven is described in many places, but the
