American culture is obsessed with the idea of progress. Progress has been embedded in the American narrative from the very beginning of its history, as colonists arrived and continually moved west in the belief that something more, something better, always awaited them tomorrow. The American Dream is the continuation of that ideal of Manifest Destiny — we always believe that there's a better life out there if we're willing to work hard. And while Manifest Destiny and the American Dream have rightfully been criticized for the horrible sufferings they inflicted on Native Americans and African Americans among other groups, the idea of progress at their root persists more strongly in Silicon Valley than virtually anywhere else. Rather than being laughed at, wildly optimistic visions of the future are encouraged (and often backed by large amounts of money). And while the claims made are often fantastic and far from reality<sup>[1](#1)</sup>, Silicon Valley's optimism is validated by the radical reshaping of society according to the vision of leaders of tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft in recent years.

Our culture's desire for progress, however flawed it often may be, is propelled by a good and universal human desire — the desire for a more prosperous, joyful, and just society than the one we were born into. We see this good desire constantly reflected in the narrative of the Bible. In this article, we'll look at the idea of progress at the beginning and end of the human story in the Bible; in a following article<sup>[2](#2)</sup>, we'll investigate how we should think about progress in the middle of the human story, where we live now. Because technology is often the means through which we seek progress, understanding the Biblical narrative of progress is crucial groundwork to finding a vision of redeemed technology.

###  The Cultural Mandate

We are introduced to the idea of human progress in the very first chapter of the Bible. After God creates humans and places them in the Garden of Eden<sup>[3](#3)</sup>, God gives them, and consequently the rest of humanity, his first command, which theologians call [The Cultural Mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_mandate):

> God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground." <br><br>
- Genesis 1:29

God, who just created everything and rules over it, invites humans to create and rule over it with him. God subsequently [rests from his work in creation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A2&version=NIV), but the work of creation isn't finished. Unlike other  creatures, God offers us the opportunity to be coworkers with him in the continuing work of creating and forming the world.

As God's image-bearers<sup>[4](#4)</sup>, we reflect God's creative character, but we don't exactly match his abilities. There aren't many people who can speak matter into existence or create life out of nothingness — God does those things with ease. But the world of Genesis is full of abundant raw materials — it's described as a garden full of water, trees, plants, birds, animals and fish. By making new things using the raw materials that have been given to us, we fulfill our role as coworkers in creation with God.

At its simplest, technology is simply the output of this creative process. One definition of technology is that it is the creative use of raw materials to accomplish or produce something that previously wasn't attainable. We can fulfill the Cultural Mandate in many ways, but creating new technology is clearly a way we participating in the creative work of God.

Furthermore, the exact language of the command to "be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it" also necessitates the creation of technology. The earliest technology of food production — grabbing food you find with your hands and eating it — could never sustain a population that would "fill the earth". Without technological progress, we could never fill the earth, let alone subdue it. Technological progress is crucial to every part of this commandment, which in many ways serves as God's mission and purpose for humanity.

### A New, Perfect City

From the creation account, we see that God intended humans to pursue progress, including technological progress, from the very beginning. But what is the purpose of this progress? To ask the existential question, why would God command humans to create new things and make the world better matter if we all die and everything we do will be destroyed by the inevitable heat death of the universe?

Thankfully, God promises us something beyond our death and the universe's death. Heaven is described in many places, but one of the most vivid images is in Revelation 21, the second to last chapter of the Bible:

> Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” <br><br>
— Revelation 21:1-4

If this is truly the world that awaits us, then all of our dreams of progress will eventually be realized. By seeking progress, we're all yearning for this heavenly city, whether we realize it or not. We become cynical, surppressing the belief that the realization of our dreams is truly possible to protect ourselves from disappointment as we strive for progress. But God promises us the realization of our grandest dreams in heaven someday.

One of the key things to notice is that the focus of this passage is a city — "the new Jerusalem". This is in direct contrast to the beginning of the Bible, where we see Eden as a garden. While a garden is unformed, a city is a product of intentional design and creation. I think that this is meant to demonstrate to us that in heaven, the Cultural Mandate has been fulfilled and is continuing to be fulfilled. We see two Biblical visions of a perfect world in the Garden of Eden and the Holy City, and to transform the Garden into the City, you need creative work to take raw materials and turn them into new things that contribute to goodness. The entire narrative of the Bible celebrates progress towards greater joy and human flourishing, from the beginning of time until the end.

Does this mean that there will be nothing to do to contribute to progress when we get to heaven? This used to be my view — I saw heaven as a static world that was maximally perfect but never changing or growing. Maybe complaining about having a perfect life is ridiculous, but something about experiencing no growth or progress in heaven bummed me out.

Fortunately, looking back at the Garden can inform a more rich view of the City. Despite the world being perfect then, humans were commanded to work alongside God to bring even more goodness to their surroundings. The perfection of Eden isn't a static peak that continues. Instead, it's a state where all things are good, whole and complete, and where progress is being made to greater realization of goodness, wholeness and completeness. That's why I said earlier that in heaven, the Cultural Mandate is continuing to be fulfilled<sup>[5](#5)</sup>. Our command to be God's coworkers in the ongoing work of creation never stops; it just continues in a new and redeemed world.

### Grounded Dreams of Progress

While these visions of progress within perfection are valuable for us, we currently live in between the Garden and the City. Our world is far from perfect, and its brokenness makes the deep need for progress obvious to all. While I wanted to save most of the discussion of this topic for a later article, I think ending with a broad ideal of how to think about progress in our world.

Ecclesiastes, one of the most peculiar and powerful books of the Bible, offers two verses that I think can be combined powerfully. The author says:

> God has made everthing beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart. <br><br>
— Ecclesiastes 3:11

This quote further confirms what we've been discussing so far. God has set eternity in our hearts, meaning that we long for the eternal and transcendent. Part of that is progress beyond the temporary nature of life today, where things decay and die. We long for an eternal, utopian world, and that's a good thing.

But while this article has painted a largely positive picture of our desire for progress, we can get carried away and lose touch with reality. This is one of the easiest criticisms of Silicon Valley and the culture of tech in general. People with grand visions of progress can become fixated on realizing that vision in the present. As a result, they overpromise, offering a vision of life that is fundamentally different than our current reality, and they can often inflict damage when these promises fail to come to fruition.

Despite the previous quote, the author of Ecclesiastes grounds his vision of the eternal in reality:

> What has been will be again,<br>
what has been done will be done again; <br>
there is nothing new under the sun. <br>
Is there anything of which one can say, <br>
"Look! This is something new"? <br>
It was here already, long ago; <br>
it was here before our time. <br><br>
— Ecclesiastes 1:9-10

The author recognizes the fact that no matter how much progress we make, nothing about our condition ultimately changes. We may have better technology and a richer culture and better health and more pleasant food, but the things that give life richness, like relationships and beauty, and the things that cause us to feel like the world isn't all that it should be, like evil and death, are still the same regardless of all that change. So while all these advancements are worth striving to acheive, we can't get carried away with trying to bring a vision of utopia to our current world. We will one day experience heaven, a utopia which will truly be unlike anything we've ever seen before, where it will no longer be true that "there is nothing new under the sun". But until then, we need to have grounded dreams of progress, recognizing that the world we can't fully heal the brokenness of the world, but daring to imagine a time when the progress we dream of will finally be reality.
